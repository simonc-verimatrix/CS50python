#Code to print meow 3 times on the screen.

# print("meow")
# print("meow")
# print("meow")

#Using while to control the loop. We need to ask a question that will
#evaluate as True or False starting likely from a count down.

# i = 3
# while i != 0:
#     print("meow")
#     i = i - 1

# If you prefer to control your loop by counting up, you can 
#redesign your code:

# i = 1
# while i <= 3 :
#     print("meow")
#     i = i + 1

#Using computer convention, you start counting from 0.

# i = 0
# while i < 3 :
#     print("meow")
# #    i = i + 1
#     i += 1          # Incrementation by 1
