x = int(input("What's x? "))
y = int(input("What's y? "))

#1 Using elif, which is a mutually exclusive statement (Two answers conditions cannot be met at once). Ie Once an a solution is found, stop evaluating.

# if x < y:
#     print("x is less than y")
# elif x > y:
#     print("x is greater than y")
# elif x == y:
#     print("x is equal to y")

# 2 Using the else condition once the first two conditions evalutate to false.
# if x < y:
#     print("x is less than y")
# elif x > y:
#     print("x is greater than y")
# else x == y:
#     print("x is equal to y")



#USING OR
#3 IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT PRECISON USING OR;

# if x < y or x > y:
#     print("x is not equal to y")

# else:
#     print("x is equal to y")


#4 SIMPLYING THE CODE SIMPLIER

if x == y:
    print("x is equal to y")
else :
    print("x is not equal y")
