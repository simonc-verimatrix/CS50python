# Conditionals allow you, the programmer, to allow your program to make decisions: 
# As if your program has the choice between taking the left-hand road or 
# the right-hand road based upon certain conditions.


## Built within Python are a set of “operators” that can are used to ask mathematical questions.
# > and < symbols are probably quite familiar to you.
# >= denotes “greater than or equal to.”
# <= denotes “less than or equal to.”
# == denotes “equals, though do notice the double equal sign! A single equal sign would assign a value. Double equal signs are used to compare variables.
# != denotes “not equal to.
# Conditional statements compare a left-hand term to a right-hand term.
